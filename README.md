# regexg

regexg is a simple regex engine based on a self defined grammer. 

regexg build the AST of the input regex and then translate it to a NFA by the  McMaughton-Yamada-Thompson alogrithm and then to a DFA by the subset construction alogrithm.

In the source code I demonstrate a simple string accept function that execute on the transition table of the DFA and find out the sentence that meet the regex rule.
